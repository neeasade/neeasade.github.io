<p>
I traveled with a group of 5 to Scotland March 22nd - 30th 2024. We made a triangle across
the top half of the island, going from Edinburgh -&gt; Oban -&gt; Inverness -&gt; Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
This is an informal dump of the details. Much of the group had not met
beforehand, but we all got on rather well and were both &ldquo;down for whatever&rdquo; and
&ldquo;committed to the bit&rdquo;.
</p>

<h2 id="Observations"><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> Observations <span class=anchor><a href="#Observations">#</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Observations">
<p>
The pastry game is insane in the UK, I started most mornings with a hunt for a
croissant and espresso, often trying other things like tarts or french fancies
along the way.
</p>

<p>
Lack of central air in most buildings and places we stayed - instead, there are
just heaters for if it gets too cold, and people open their windows if it gets
too hot.
</p>

<p>
(In Edinburgh and Inverness) coffee shop hours are about 8-3pm. after that they
all close and all the pubs open, the street sort of transforms.
</p>

<p>
The farther north you go, the thicker the accent.
</p>

<p>
If using cash, you&rsquo;ll be dealing with more coins than you&rsquo;re used to as an
American - there are Â£1 and Â£2 coins.
</p>

<p>
Every stray cat we saw was very friendly and cuddly.
</p>

<p>
The weather tried to kill us, it was cold and windy and death. Before the trip I
was debating a hoodie, so glad I took my jacket.
</p>

<p>
Trains rock - we didn&rsquo;t rent a car, and seeing how small the roads are here I
don&rsquo;t regret that at all.
</p>

<p>
Hostels aren&rsquo;t as social as you might imagine.
</p>

<p>
I definitely felt like an &ldquo;American&rdquo; over there (in slight contrast with
&ldquo;Gringo&rdquo; when traveling in Mexico).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lemonade&rdquo; in the UK is 7-up or sprite

<li>Kill the extra time on Kerrara hiking the other way to see the farmstore

take and leave money in the changebox</li>

Some how I&rsquo;ve completely forgotten what we did this day. Maybe I&rsquo;ll get an

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Adam and I sleep early because there&rsquo;s a train in the morning</li>
<li>The youngun&rsquo;s go out and end up going hard AF in inverness:</li>
<li>They start the night at highlander</li>
<li>Peters plays defence against a persistent suitor dancing into Anna</li>
<li>They meet some locals (two long haired lasses) hit it off dancing
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>JK, turns out to be one long haired lass and one long haired lad</li>
<li>The lass is nice and flirty, but also smelly</li>
</ul></li>
<li>highlander closes and they wander over to the forest fox(?)</li>
<li>They close out forest fox, but the locals know a place!</li>
<li>On the way to the next place, they learn the destination is actually a strip club</li>
<li>They&rsquo;re REALLY excited about getting peters a lapdance</li>
<li>Peters is not interested in a lap dance, and the other 2 have SO&rsquo;s and are
ready to call it a night</li>
<li>They split amicably, but there&rsquo;s a creepy straggler, whom Peters staves off
