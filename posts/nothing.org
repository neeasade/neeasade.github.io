What is an everything/nothing (aka E/N) website?

Once I thought it was a site where there was no theme, and so you get inane
details of someone's personal life mixed in with content you might be interested
in, so you find "everything" and in so doing find nothing.

But I can't find that definition now -- I also thought I saw something about the
content meaning everything to the author, and nothing to anyone else.

Today I went on a nice bike ride. If you are reading this and have not been
outside today, I would consider it, even just a short stroll :)
