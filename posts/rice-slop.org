For a little over a year now, I have been increasingly obsessed with a meal I
have lovingly termed "rice slop". A friend asked me to write some of the process
down, so here we are.

The beauty of rice slop is almost none of the measurements are precise, you can
just toss in the ingredients and hit the "cook" button and then BAM you are set
for a meal or 5 depending on the size of your rice cooker and ingredients.

Rice slop is made in a rice cooker, with different layers of ingredients. There
are typically 3 layers, like so:

| Layer                 | Notes                                    |
| rice (bottom)         | Jasmine rice + various sauces            |
| meat (middle          | pre cooked chicken or tuna               |
| veggies n beans (top) | frozen or canned vegetables, pinto beans |

** Layer 1 (rice)

I usually use jasmin rice, using 1 [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ge_(unit)][Ge]] for a smaller batch, or 2 for a larger one.

Rinse the rice in a strainer (or sifter) and then place jasmine rice and water in a 1:1 ratio in the rice cooker bowl.

Now for the fun part - mix in any of the following for flavor:

- chicken bouillon cube
- hot sauce (I usually use sriracha)
- garlic cloves
- chili crisp
- sesame seed oil (just a few drops)
- soy sauce
- teriyaki sauce
- oyster sauce
- salsa

Basically any misc sauce or seasoning that your curious about can be thrown in
at this stage. I'll put it this way, I've never over seasoned my rice slop. If
you want to keep it simple, maybe start with just salsa?

Mix ingredients together and you're done with layer one ðŸ˜Ž

** Layer 2 (meat)

I usually use precooked grilled chicken from the grocery store. A can of tuna
(drained first) works nicely as well. Just lay it on top of the rice + sauce
mixture (*no mixing*).

** Layer 3 (veggies n beans)

I usually use a frozen or canned vegetable pack for this stage, just lay them on
top of the meat. Do the same with a can of pinto beans.

Hit the cook button and you are DONE (mix together layers after the rice cooker button pops)

** Streamlined example: tuna slop

Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup of jasmine rice
- 1/2 cup of water
- soy sauce
- a can of tuna
- stir fry vegetable mix (or asian mix, or whatever sticks out to you)
- (optional) 1 can pinto beans

howto:

- Place rice and water in rice cooker.
- Add a shit ton of soy sauce, mix
- Drain tuna can, throw on top
- Throw veggies and optionally beans in there
- Hit the cook button, and wait for your savory bowl
