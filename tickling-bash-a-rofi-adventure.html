<b>tl;dr</b>: I wanted to stop reading stdin after the first newline to stdout, and I did a hacky thing to get that, the essence of which is:
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">sh -c <span style="color: #007c00;">'echo $$; echo a; sleep 100; echo b'</span> | (<span style="color: #0065c8;">read</span> pid; <span style="color: #0065c8;">read</span> line; <span style="color: #0065c8;">echo</span> <span style="color: #007c00;">"$line"</span>; <span style="color: #0065c8;">kill</span> $<span style="color: #c6007f;">pid</span>)
</pre>
</div>

<p>
I really like selecting things from fuzzy searchin&rsquo; keyboard-driven menus. There&rsquo;s something magical
about being able to bring up a menu, mash a few buttons, and get to where you are going. There are
lots of really cool generic &ldquo;select thing from list&rdquo; programs out there. As time goes on, you think
of more things you might do, and some take <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqbHe9X4PWU">it</a> <a href="https://github.com/BelkaDev/RofiFtw">really</a> <a href="https://keminglabs.com/finda/">far</a>.

<div id="outline-container-Setup" class="outline-2">

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Setup">
<p>
Let&rsquo;s go through some history first. dmenu2 was my goto &rsquo;selector&rsquo; for years, because it has some
neat features like positional arguments and the ability to specify the colorscheme from Xresources.
In my day to day, occasionally I would find a neat use or have a cool idea, and then integrate it
into my setup. Stuff like &ldquo;search mpd songs and insert one at the current playlist position&rdquo; or
&ldquo;select a password to copy into the clipboard&rdquo;. Wow this is all super cool! We can just do things
and integrate them with little script ideas, neat.
</p>

<p>
Eventually I had a hankering for a &ldquo;mega dmenu script&rdquo;. I&rsquo;d seen rofi here and there, and one of
it&rsquo;s features was a builting &ldquo;switch to window by title&rdquo; feature, which is pretty cool! I right away
stole the idea in a <a href="https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/blob/master/wm/.wm/scripts/interact/dmenu_windows">dmenu script</a>. But then I got to thinking, what if I had a &ldquo;switch to everything&rdquo;
script. The vision I had in my head of a single hub to jump to or DO anything was a really nice
picture, indeed. And thus, <code>dmenu_switcher</code> was born, a script I would then shout about many times.
<code>dmenu_switcher</code> is a script that matches dmenu selections to bash functions in an associated array &#x2013;
so I added actions to:
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>jump to window</li>
<li>jump to browser tab</li>
<li>jump to open file in emacs</li>
</ul>

<p>
In the process of implementing that last point, I realized I might not need dmenu after all. Within
emacs itself, I was using <a href="https://oremacs.com/swiper/">ivy</a> to switch to things. From there I learned that you can spawn an emacs
frame that is solely a minibuffer, and that meant the next step was to create a dmenu-like <a href="https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bin/emacs_dmenu">script</a>
that just spawned an emacs frame containing ivy. In combination with <a href="https://github.com/raxod502/prescient.el">prescient.el</a> this means my
&ldquo;mega menu&rdquo; gets extra sorting based on selected entries &#x2013; previously selected things automatically
float to the top! How nice. However, I&rsquo;m already using dmenu in many places. This leads to me making
a script in my path also named dmenu pointing at <a href="https://github.com/neeasade/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bin/emacs_dmenu">emacs_dmenu</a>.
</p>

<p>
Such is the state of things for a few months.
</p>

<p>
In the past few weeks, I&rsquo;ve been practicing my touch typing. As you get a little faster, latency starts to matter. If emacs is lagging it&rsquo;s like I&rsquo;m typing through the mud (tangent: emacs was lagging and I <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/evil-escape/pull/91#issuecomment-622970007">found out why</a>). You start noticing things. Things like the fact that dmenu (and my <code>emacs_dmenu</code> wrapper) BLOCK UNTIL STDIN IS READ. After performing some tweaks I was down to ~100ms for gathering all the jump candidates. emacs takes about another 100ms to create a frame on my machine. A 200ms bump is quite noticable in the &ldquo;flow&rdquo; of things (you have an action in mind, you mash the keybind and start typing then OOPS I just sent gibberish to my text editor).
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Rofi" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Rofi"><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> Rofi <span class=anchor><a href="#Rofi">#</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Rofi">
<p>
At this point I decided to check out <a href="https://github.com/davatorium/rofi">rofi</a> &#x2013; and was rewarded with the very nice <code>-async-pre-read</code>
flag. Setting the value to 0 means that rofi will start accepting keyboard input right away. That
means I can just summon the jump menu and start typing before candidates are ready. This is a golden
experience! It means I can include search candidates that take a long time to get (say, my browser
history in the past week) but still start typing right away.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-Tickling-bash-(cheating)" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="Tickling-bash-(cheating)"><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> Tickling bash (cheating) <span class=anchor><a href="#Tickling-bash-(cheating)">#</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-Tickling-bash-(cheating)">
<p>
So, I&rsquo;m using rofi in dmenu mode, because I&rsquo;m using it as a dmenu replacement. This means I&rsquo;m at the mercy of the shell (pipelines waiting for stdin to be read before returning). An example is shown below (rofi pops up, you select the &rsquo;a&rsquo; option before &rsquo;b&rsquo; is ready, you are stuck):
</p>

<div class="org-src-container">
<pre class="src src-sh">(<span style="color: #0065c8;">echo</span> a; sleep 10; <span style="color: #0065c8;">echo</span> b) | rofi -dmenu -async-pre-read 0
</pre>
</div>

<p>
You see the issue with this? After I select something (intending to move on to an action), I&rsquo;m stuck again! until all the candidates have been created. Yet another bump in what I&rsquo;m trying to do. Clearly, this is an insult and I must make the machine do my bidding. This is not a fault with rofi &#x2013; it returns right away after selecting an option, as expected.
</p>

<p>
So the way I cheated was to run the &rsquo;candidate maker&rsquo; in a subshell, pass it&rsquo;s pid along to my wrapper, and kill it once rofi returned. Can&rsquo;t pass options when your dead. A shortened version of this fix may be found at the top of this post, but here&rsquo;s some links showing the use in my wrapper (gross):

</ul>

Since posting this, I have returned to emacs as a general-purpose selector &#x2013; the auto-frecency from prescient is just too nice.
