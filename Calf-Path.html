<h1 class=title>The Calf Path</h1>
</p>


<hr>

<p>
A poem by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sam_Walter_Foss">Sam Foss</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-I." class="outline-2">
<h2 id="I."><span class="section-number-2">1.</span> I. <span class=anchor><a href="#I.">⚓</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-I.">
<p>
One day through the primeval wood<br/>
A calf walked home as good calves should;
</p>

<p>
But made a trail all bent askew,<br/>
A crooked trail as all calves do.
</p>

<p>
Since then three hundred years have fled,<br/>
And I infer the calf is dead.
</p>
</div>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-II." class="outline-2">
<h2 id="II."><span class="section-number-2">2.</span> II. <span class=anchor><a href="#II.">⚓</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-II.">
<p>
But still he left behind his trail,<br/>
And thereby hangs my moral tale.
</p>

<p>
The trail was taken up next day,<br/>
By a lone dog that passed that way;
</p>

<p>
And then a wise bell-wether sheep<br/>
Pursued the trail o&rsquo;er vale and steep,
</p>

<p>
And drew the flock behind him, too,<br/>
As good bell-wethers always do.
</p>

<p>
And from that day, o&rsquo;er hill and glade.<br/>
Through those old woods a path was made.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-III." class="outline-2">
<h2 id="III."><span class="section-number-2">3.</span> III. <span class=anchor><a href="#III.">⚓</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-III.">
<p>
And many men wound in and out,<br/>
And dodged, and turned, and bent about,
</p>

<p>
And uttered words of righteous wrath,<br/>
Because &rsquo;twas such a crooked path;
</p>

<p>
But still they followed—do not laugh—<br/>
The first migrations of that calf,
</p>

<p>
And through this winding wood-way stalked<br/>
Because he wobbled when he walked.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-IV." class="outline-2">
<h2 id="IV."><span class="section-number-2">4.</span> IV. <span class=anchor><a href="#IV.">⚓</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-IV.">
<p>
This forest path became a lane,<br/>
that bent and turned and turned again;
</p>

<p>
This crooked lane became a road,<br/>
Where many a poor horse with his load
</p>

<p>
Toiled on beneath the burning sun,<br/>
And traveled some three miles in one.
</p>

<p>
And thus a century and a half<br/>
They trod the footsteps of that calf.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-V." class="outline-2">
<h2 id="V."><span class="section-number-2">5.</span> V. <span class=anchor><a href="#V.">⚓</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-V.">
<p>
The years passed on in swiftness fleet,<br/>
The road became a village street;
</p>

<p>
And this, before men were aware,<br/>
A city&rsquo;s crowded thoroughfare.
</p>

<p>
And soon the central street was this<br/>
Of a renowned metropolis;
</p>

<p>
And men two centuries and a half,<br/>
Trod in the footsteps of that calf.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-VI." class="outline-2">
<h2 id="VI."><span class="section-number-2">6.</span> VI. <span class=anchor><a href="#VI.">⚓</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-VI.">
<p>
Each day a hundred thousand rout<br/>
Followed the zigzag calf about
</p>

<p>
And o&rsquo;er his crooked journey went<br/>
The traffic of a continent.
</p>

<p>
A Hundred thousand men were led,<br/>
By one calf near three centuries dead.
</p>

<p>
They followed still his crooked way,<br/>
And lost one hundred years a day;
</p>

<p>
For thus such reverence is lent,<br/>
To well established precedent.
</p>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-VII." class="outline-2">
<h2 id="VII."><span class="section-number-2">7.</span> VII. <span class=anchor><a href="#VII.">⚓</a></span></h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-VII.">
<p>
A moral lesson this might teach<br/>
Were I ordained and called to preach;
</p>

<p>
For men are prone to go it blind<br/>
Along the calf-paths of the mind,
</p>

<p>
And work away from sun to sun,<br/>
To do what other men have done.
</p>

<p>
They follow in the beaten track,<br/>
And out and in, and forth and back,
</p>

<p>
And still their devious course pursue,<br/>
To keep the path that others do.
</p>

<p>
They keep the path a sacred groove,<br/>
Along which all their lives they move.
</p>

<p>
But how the wise old wood gods laugh,<br/>
Who saw the first primeval calf.
</p>

<p>
Ah, many things this tale might teach—<br/>
But I am not ordained to preach.
