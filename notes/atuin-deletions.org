[[https://atuin.sh/][atuin]] is great at remembering things, but sometimes you want it to forget.

*delete by exit code* 127 is basically always typos for me

#+begin_src sh
atuin search --exit 127 "" --delete
#+end_src

*delete by search* (exact match substring)

#+begin_src sh
# list
atuin search --search-mode fulltext corn

# delete
atuin search --search-mode fulltext corn --delete
#+end_src

*delete an individual command invocation*

in terminal, ~ctrl-r~ to bring up atuin search - hit ~ctrl-o~ to use inspector on a
specific command, and then ~ctrl-d~ to delete it

*delete keyvalue stores by substring in the key*
#+begin_src sh
# list:
atuin kv list -n dirs | grep blag

# delete:
atuin kv list -n dirs | grep blag  | xargs -n1 atuin kv delete -n dirs
#+end_src
