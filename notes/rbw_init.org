Setup new computer recently, forgot how this works

rbw is [[https://github.com/doy/rbw][rbw]], and in combination with [[https://github.com/fdw/rofi-rbw][rofi-rbw]] it has replaced my [[https://www.passwordstore.org/][passwordstore]] flow.

first:

#+begin_src bash
rbw config set email "foo@bar.com"
#+end_src

second, call ~rbw register~ -- you will need the api credentials from bitwarden. You
can get them from bitwarden under ~settings / security / keys / API Key~
